Steps:

1. Select Code Column & Create Average Column
2. Filter out any that are not within 4 most recent years from todays date
3. Group by Code Rows where gdp_per_capita is above 40000
4. Order by column 2 in Desc Order, Step 1 column 2 is the average column
5. Limit to top 3

SELECT code, AVG(govt_debt / gdp_per_capita)
FROM countries
WHERE year >= DATEADD(yyyy, -4, GETDATE())
GROUP BY code
HAVING MIN(gdp_per_capita) >= 40000
ORDER BY 2 DESC
