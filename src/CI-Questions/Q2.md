Steps:

1. Create a class Man, with constructor of mouth, closed by default, and a request of who is requesting.
2. openMouth method will take in request as a parameter, if the request is either himself, or a doctor, AND his mouth is closed, man's mouth will open. Otherwise will remain closed.
3. closeMouth method will take in request as a parameter, if the request is either himself, or a doctor, AND his mouth is open, man's mouth will close. Otherwise will remain open.

class Man {
constructor(request) {
this.mouth = 'closed'
this.request = request
}

    openMouth(request) {
        if (request === 'self' && this.mouth == 'closed') {
            this.mouth == 'open'
        } else if (request === 'doctor' && this.mouth == 'closed') {
            this.mouth == 'open'
        }
    }

    closeMouth(request) {
        if (request === 'self' && this.mouth == 'open') {
            this.mouth == 'closed'
        }   } else if (request === 'doctor' && this.mouth == 'open') {
            this.mouth == 'closed'
        }
    }

}
